This feature enables the agent to automatically summarize long conversations to maintain context without exceeding token limits.

When the conversation history becomes too long, the system will:
1.  Archive the oldest part of the dialogue.
2.  Generate a concise summary of key information and decisions.
3.  Inject the summary back into the context.

As an AI, you should pay attention to the "Previous Context Summary" provided in the system messages and use it to maintain continuity.
